ConcertStager is an application designed to streamline the organization and participation in concerts for organizers, performers, and attendees. The project includes several key functionalities to enhance the user experience and improve concert management efficiency.

The user management module allows for the creation and management of profiles for various roles, including organizers, musicians, and attendees. This module enables users to store and modify their information seamlessly. The concert management module handles the application process for musicians, displays available concerts, and facilitates communication between organizers and musicians through an integrated chat system.

A review system is incorporated to allow users to rate concerts, musicians, and venues, providing valuable feedback and improving overall quality. For authentication, the application uses Google Sign-In, offering secure login capabilities through users' Google accounts.

ConcertStager also includes comprehensive API and database integration. The MSSQL database is used for data storage and processing, while the API layer ensures smooth communication between the mobile application and the backend.

Key features of ConcertStager include user login and profile creation, concert creation and discovery, rating of concerts and performers, and the application and selection process for performers. This project emphasizes efficient concert planning and user engagement, aiming to provide a seamless experience for all users involved.
